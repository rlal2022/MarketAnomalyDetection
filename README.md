MarketAnomalyDetection
Overview
MarketAnomalyDetection is a GPT-powered investment chatbot designed to help users make informed decisions by predicting market trends and suggesting data-driven investment strategies. The chatbot utilizes real-time data analysis and machine learning models to identify potential market crashes and provide personalized investment advice.

This project demonstrates the power of AI and machine learning in the finance sector, offering users insights into market behavior and recommendations on how to navigate different market conditions.

Purpose
The main goal of this project is to build an interactive, AI-powered chatbot that:

Predicts market crashes using historical data and anomaly detection techniques.
Recommends investment strategies based on the detected market trends, helping users minimize losses or optimize returns.
Explains the strategy in simple terms, making financial decisions more accessible to everyday investors.
Features
Market Prediction: Predicts whether the market is likely to crash or remain stable using an anomaly detection model.
Investment Strategy Recommendations: Suggests growth investments during stable conditions and safer, low-risk investments when a crash is predicted.
Performance Comparison: Compares the proposed investment strategy to a simple buy-and-hold approach.
Real-Time Insights: Provides dynamic, AI-generated responses to user queries, explaining market predictions and investment actions.
Interactive Chatbot: Built using GPT-3 (or GPT-4), offering users an easy-to-use interface to ask questions about their investments and the market.
Milestones
Milestone 1: Market Anomaly Detection
Objective: Develop an anomaly detection model to identify market crashes using historical financial data.
Outcome: The model classifies market conditions as either “crash” or “no crash,” helping to predict market volatility.
Milestone 2: Investment Strategy Recommendations
Objective: Based on the anomaly detection model, propose data-driven investment strategies to minimize risks or optimize returns.
Outcome: The system suggests either growth investments or safe assets based on the predicted market conditions.
Milestone 3: GPT-Powered Chatbot Integration
Objective: Design and integrate an AI-driven chatbot that explains the investment strategy to users in a clear, actionable manner.
Outcome: The chatbot allows users to ask questions about market predictions, recommended actions, and the performance of their portfolios.
Technologies Used
OpenAI GPT-3 (or GPT-4): For generating AI-driven responses and explaining investment strategies.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the anomaly detection model.
How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MarketAnomalyDetection.git
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up OpenAI API
Make sure you have an OpenAI API key. You can get it by creating an account at OpenAI's API platform. Add your key in the script:

python
Copy code
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
4. Run the Application
After setting up everything, run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run investment_bot_app.py
This will open the application in your browser, where you can interact with the investment chatbot.

Example Questions
You can interact with the chatbot by asking questions such as:

"What is the current market prediction?"
"What investment action should I take right now?"
"How does my investment strategy compare to buy-and-hold?"
The bot will provide responses based on the current market conditions and historical data analysis.

Future Improvements
Real-Time Market Data Integration: Fetch live stock prices and financial data from APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or others.
Personalized User Profiles: Allow users to set preferences for risk tolerance and tailor investment recommendations.
Machine Learning Model Enhancement: Improve the accuracy of market crash predictions by training the model on a more extensive dataset.
